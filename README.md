## Project Status

Note: I have successfully built and implemented all layers and the full structure of the application, with all features functioning as expected. The only outstanding issue is with the local storage provider, which requires some adjustments. I have a clear understanding of how to resolve it but, due to time constraints, I haven't been able to complete the necessary changes. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss the solution further, as Iâ€™m confident I can address it promptly with some additional time. Thank you for your understanding.
